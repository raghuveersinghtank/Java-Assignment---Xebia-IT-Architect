Summary

As requested the use case in the exercise is implemented in a generic way such that discounts can easily be created and applied to bills. The main test cases are in BillTest. The discounts in the exercise are created in DiscountServiceImpl. Below is a summary of my approach, rationale and completed activities.

Coding exercise:

On a retail website, the following discounts apply: 

1.If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount 

2.If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount 

3.If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount. 

4.For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount). 

5.The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries. 

6.A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill. 

Write a program with test cases such that given a bill, it finds the net payable amount. Please note the stress is on object oriented approach and test coverage. What we care about: 

•object oriented programming approach 

•unit test (may be using xUnit) and code coverage 
•code to be generic and simple 
•leverage today's best coding practices 
•clear README.md that explains how the code and the test can be run and how the coverage reports can be generated

Getting Started 
1.To start with, you can create one GitHub Repository for the project share it with us. 
2.You need to regularly commit your progress to the GitHub repository and let us know once the exercise is completed.
